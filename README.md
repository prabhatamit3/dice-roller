HTML code is used to design the basic structure of the project. The HTML code contains the container class that holds the playerâ€™s name and initial dice phase. Another bottom div contains the two buttons (one button for roll the dice and another button for rename the player name).

The JavaScript code contains the functionality of Dice Game. The first functionality is to rename the player name after clicking the button. Another functionality is to roll the dice after clicking the button. After rolling the dice by both the player, anyone player will win who get the highest phase value. If both players get the same phase value then the game will draw.
